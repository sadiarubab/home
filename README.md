### About Me

I completed my PhD in Computer Science and Technology at the College of  Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, under the guidance of [Professor Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org/). My PhD research focuses on multi-modal data representation and interaction, particularly integrating non-speech audio with interactive data visualizations. I have also worked on making authoring tools for visualization construction and analysis more accessible. Before my PhD. I received my M-Phil degree in Computer Science from Quaid-i-Azam UniversityÂ [QAU](http://cs.qau.edu.pk/index.php). I carried out research in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, with a focus on information-seeking behavior and interactive systems.  I received my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Fatima Jinnah Women University.  I currently serve as a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at [COMSATS University, Islamabad Attock Campus](https://www.comsats.edu.pk/), bringing over 10 years of experience in teaching at the university level.
